"bacterium" is the singular and "bacteria" is the plural


Currently, we estimate that there are probably some **10 million plant and animal species on the planet.** In contrast, the estimate for microbial species is around 1 trillion. Microbial species outnumber plant and animal species by **100,000**.


There are two important take-home messages from this fact.
	1. we as humans are born and live our entire lives completely surrounded by microbes. In fact, the microbes in our digestive tract are an integral part of our body. Think of them as an additional organ containing hundreds of different species.
	2. and going back to our original question of whether microbes are safe to eat, despite the fact that some microbes cause awful diseases, among the estimated trillion species of microbes, ==only a few dozen are able to cause disease in humans==. So by and large, microbes are safe to eat. That is particularly true about the microbes that are used to produce microbial foods. But still, care should be taken in food preparation because there are certainly some very nasty microbes out there that

Classify these microbes as harmful or safe to eat
	_Penicillium roqueforti_  - safe to eat      
	_Clostridium botulinum_ - harmful
	_Campylobacter_ - harmful
	_Penicillium candidum_ - safe to eat   


Given this, we can now guess that 
 - the reason you might add sugar to bread is to give the yeast an easily accessible source of food. 
 - And the reason we place the dough in a warm place is because the yeast are happier there. 
 - And the reason we have to wait for the dough to rise is because although the yeast are quick, they're living organisms and still take some time to do their work.

### Metabolism and Growth

Cooking uses heat to break down molecules in our food, making it easier for our bodies to extract nutrients from it. ==Fermentation  ‘cooking with microbes’ - uses microbes to break down molecules in our food.==When we eat fermented foods, we are eating foods that microbes have already partially digested for us.

>Microbes and humans need to eat because they need energy to live. But exactly how do we find and they derive energy from food?

**Aerobic respiration**
What are you breathing in? Well, air, of course.
В процессе дыханий наш организм использовал кислород из воздуха в процессе расщепления пищи, которую мы съели сегодня утром. Наш организм извлекал из этого энергию. А углекислый газ, который мы выдыхаем, образуется как побочный
продукт, который нам больше не нужен. Глюкоза и другие питательные вещества, содержащиеся в нашей пище, преобразуются в CO2. Другими словами, атомы углерода и кислорода в CO2 поступают из самой пищи. И мы преобразовали кислород из воздуха в воду.
В то же время энергия, содержащаяся в пищевых продуктах, передается молекуле которая называется АТФ.
this process  is called aerobic respiration because it requires oxygen. It is how humans metabolize food.And it is also what the microbes do at the very start of the bread and meat recipes.

ATP is a molecule with very high energy bonds. And when those bonds are broken, that energy can be used for the multitude of necessary chemical reactions needed to keep us alive.
Cells use ATP to store energy from your food in a form that they can use later for many different cellular processes.


**Anaerobic respiration**
While humans can't survive without oxygen, microbes can simply switch to another mode of metabolism. If you ask a microbe to hold its breath or put it in an environment where there is no oxygen, it would be just fine. In fact, more than fine. Many microbes are very effective at this mode of metabolism and thrive in environments where there is no oxygen. We call this mode of metabolism **anaerobic**, meaning without air, and therefore without oxygen **or we call it fermentation**.


In one sense, fermentation can be seen as a contrast to respiration. **Fermentation is less efficient than respiration, but it still works**. The cells can only produce small amounts of ATP, and consequently produce smaller amounts of CO2 as well. 
As we'll see, wonderful things happen to glucose during fermentation. And this is key as far as fermented foods and beverages are concerned. ==Key to this process is that as the microbes break down their food, they produce additional molecules as byproducts. These molecules can help flavor and preserve our food. ==
There are two main fermentation pathways.
- One is lactic acid fermentation, which plays a big role in the production of many fermented dairy foods, such as yogurt and cheese.
	In the case of lactic acid fermentation, one of the byproducts is lactic acid, which can give fermented dairy products a sour or tangy flavor. The only time humans can be said to ferment is in the cells of tired muscles. For example, when the muscles of a long distance runner cannot get enough oxygen to meet their energy needs, they build up lactic acid, which can be quite painful.
- The second fermentation pathway is called alcoholic fermentation.
	And it's essential for  the production of such microbial beverages as beer and wine.

These days, the word fermentation has come to denote only the metabolic pathway, but a lay term to mean any food where microbes have been involved.


Microbes are just like us. But different.
Both microbes and humans break down glucose into two pyruvate molecules through a process called glycolysis. 
 - Human cells, in the presence of oxygen, then move those pyruvate molecules into the mitochondria and break them down further into water, carbon dioxide, and in the process make a lot of ATP, the energy currency of the cell. This process is called respiration. 
 - In the absence of oxygen, both humans and some bacteria turn pyruvate into lactic acid. 
 - In alcoholic fermentation, yeast convert pyruvate into ethanol/alcohol.
